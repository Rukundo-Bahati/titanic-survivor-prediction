<h1>Titanic Survivor Predictor Model</h1>
<p></p>Predict the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning.</p>
This project leverages the famous Titanic dataset to explore feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques in predicting passenger survival.

<h3>🚀 Project Overview</h3>
The Titanic Survivor Predictor Model is a machine learning classification model built to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on several factors like age, gender, class, and more. 
<p>The model uses supervised learning algorithms, and the final outcome is evaluated to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.</p>

<h3>📁 Dataset</h3>
The dataset used is from the Titanic competition on Kaggle and includes the following key features:

PassengerId: ID assigned to each passenger
Survived: Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger’s name
Sex: Gender
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

<h3>⚙️ Project Structure</h3>
data/: Folder containing the Titanic dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, visualization, and modeling.
models/: Serialized trained models (e.g., .pkl files).
src/: Scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.


🚀 Future Work
Explore deep learning models for prediction.
Implement more advanced feature engineering.
Fine-tune hyperparameters further for improved accuracy.
